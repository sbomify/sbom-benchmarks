# SBOM Generation for Docker
[![Docker](https://github.com/sbomify/sbom-benchmarks/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sbomify/sbom-benchmarks/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

The full process is automated and you can see the exact commands we run in [docker.yml](https://github.com/sbomify/sbom-benchmarks/blob/master/.github/workflows/docker.yml).

If you look at the [Docker CI/CD run](https://github.com/sbomify/sbom-benchmarks/actions/workflows/docker.yml), you can also see the quality score of the SBOMs (from `sbomqsq`) as well as downloading the actual SBOMs as artifact.
