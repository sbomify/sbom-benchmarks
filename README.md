This repository is designed to generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) using a comprehensive benchmark across a wide variety of tools on a defined target across multiple programming languages. The goal is to provide a consistent and standardized method for evaluating and comparing the effectiveness and accuracy of various SBOM generation tools, helping users to identify the best tool for their specific needs.

The list of tools used is pulled from our [SBOM resources](https://sbomify.com/resources/) page that includes a comprehensive list of SBOM tools.

## Features

* Multi-Tool Support: Run benchmarks across a diverse set of SBOM generation tools.
* Cross-Language Compatibility: Supports multiple programming languages, allowing for comprehensive analysis regardless of the technology stack.
* Automated Workflow: Easily set up and execute benchmarks with minimal manual intervention.
* Detailed Reports: Generate detailed comparisons and summaries of the SBOMs produced by different tools, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.
* Extensibility: Add support for new tools or languages with minimal configuration changes.
